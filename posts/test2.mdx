  This was one of my very first prototypes for a high velocity & high performance usage metrics systems. I made this in during a coffee break and then slapped together a prototype python API and backend service which was just a fork of statsd with some hacking. This prototype would evolve into a more complete system and suite of tools that is now very heavily used at my current employer. When I pitched this to my boss at the time there was a lot of skeptism about the design and scalability. Over a few iterations with a working prototype, they were eventually on board. The first 'real' version didn't have a database, it just wrote the metrics to disk and you could visit the service to see a list in raw html, after that it became a major service used by many developers.

  Product design and engineering has never been more mainstream than today. All the buzzwords and processes that exist to guide good product design and engineering can sometimes lead us afar and we lose sight of the users, their problems, and our inspiration. We can lost in the details or caught up in analysis. But if there is one thing to remember its to always be prototyping.
