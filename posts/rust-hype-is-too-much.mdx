title: Let's not overhype rust.
date: '2023-11-04'
description: >-
  Rust is growing in popularity and hype but we should be cautious about overselling it. I can already hear the rustaceans sharpening their claws, but hear me out.
  As rust evangelists, we need to be vigilant around overhyping, or rather overselling, the language.

Rust is awesome. The developer tooling is "chef's kiss". The lanaguage is powerful and helpful.
I have been using rust in production for a little over 2 years now and I am sold! If you are a developer
in need of a highly performant and safe language, rust is worth adding to your shortlist. But, lets not oversell it.

A bit of context: At the time of writing this, I am a lead software engineer at a major visual effects company.
Our collective code base is primarily python and C++ based and we have only recently started to embrace service oriented
systems where it makes sense. I work with people who have been writing C++ and Python before it was popular and in demand. I personally
starting using python with version 2.6. Our digital content creation applications (aka DCCs) are primarily C++
applications with embedded python APIs exposed for data pipeline building. This has made C++ and Python the backbone for the majority of our data pipelines due to its
ease of use, adoption, and availability.

Rust has been rushing into the development world and its exciting! It brings with so many great features and paradigms
for a genre of development that requires highly performant runtimes with low-level access and solid memory safety! Many of my peers are excited
about the possibilities to allow us to write incredible performant code without all the pitfalls of C/C++.

That said, rust evangelists, like myself, need to exercise caution about being over zealous about what the language can bring. Even saying rust will "allow us to
write incredibly performant code with all the pitfalls of C/C++" is, at best, a passionate overstatement and at worst a dense and uninformed half-truth.

- as we do along my hope is to provide a few ways we can be better evangelists and make the community for rust less intimidating and stronger.
- want to avoid ciche, not about the langaguad is a tool, engineering is more than about the tool, the problem is skill not the tool.


## Know thy audience
- Many C++/C developers have years of experience solving complex memory problems. They are not afraid of memory management.
- Many python developers are not interested in the complexities of memory management. They are interested in solving problems.
- Many C++/C developers are not using the latest and greatest C++ paradigms.
- People are always skeptical of new tools, not because they are afraid of change but because the are afraid of being ineffective.

## Memory safety is not a pancea.
- Rust prioritizes memory safety but that is not always the problem that needs to be solved.
- Rust has in mind how a code will evolve over time while C++ is concerned with how it can be controlled now.
- Modern C++ has made great strides in memory safety.
- Many of rusts features can be viewed as burdensome and an unnecessary paradigm shift.
- Selling rust memory safety through the lense of multithreading maybe a good approach.
- Moving to rust because it has better memory safety is like migrating from python to elixir because it has better concurrency, its true but it may now mean alot in context.

## Brownfield development is key.
- The company I work at has been around for 40+ years. We have a lot of legacy code.
- Rust developer tooling is amazing for new projects but try inte grating it into a legacy codebase.
- Rust has great FFI tools and its macro system makes such tooling an amazing (and sometimes opaque) experience.
- If I cannot integrate rust into my existing codebase, I am not going to use it.
- We are not talking about migrating 5 year code, we are taling about code that has been around for 20+ years.
- Rust may actually make it slower.

## Bind me hard.
- Python bindings are at the core of our industry.
- We have a lot of legacy code that needs to interop with C/C++ code.
- Highlighting rusts ability to bind to other languages is a huge selling point.
- Macros are fucking amazing
