Rust is awesome. The developer tooling is "chef's kiss". The lanaguage is equal parts powerful and safe.
I have been using rust in production for a while now and I am very happy with it! If you are a developer
in need of a highly performant and safe language, rust is a great choice. But, lets not oversell it.

A bit of context: At the time of writing this, I am a lead software engineer at a major visual effects company. 
Our collective code base is primarily python and C++ based and we have only recently started to embrace service oriented 
systems where it makes sense. I work with people who have been writing C++ and Python before it was novel. I personally
starting using python with version 2.5. Our digital content creation applications (DCCs) are primarily C++ 
applications with embedded python apis. Python is the backbone of the majority of our data pipelines due to its
ease of use and availability.

Rust has been rushing into the development world and its exciting! It brings with so many great features and paradigms
for a genre of development that requires highly performance, low-level access, and saftey! Many of my peers are excited
about the possibilities to allow use to write incredible performant code without all the pitfalls of C/C++. 

That said, rust evangelists, like myself, need to be cautious about being zealots. For some natural reason,
when a new exciting language, paradigm, or idea comes into the scene there is a desire to juxtapose it to the 
death of a "thing". Some rustaceans harald its coming as the end of C++ and any who oppose its progress are just
trogolodytes hampering the progress of its natural evolution...or at least that is how it can come across. I am not convinced
that is helpful to the adoption within the community or the language. 

## Know thy audience
- Many C++/C developers have years of experience solving complex memory problems. They are not afraid of memory management.
- Many python developers are not interested in the complexities of memory management. They are interested in solving problems.
- Many C++/C developers are not using the latest and greatest C++ paradigms.
- People are always skeptical of new tools, not because they are afraid of change but because the are afraid of being ineffective.

## Memory safety is not a pancea.
- Rust prioritizes memory safety but that is not always the problem that needs to be solved.
- Rust has in mind how a code will evolve over time while C++ is concerned with how it can be controlled now.
- Modern C++ has made great strides in memory safety.
- Many of rusts features can be viewed as burdensome and an unnecessary paradigm shift.
- Selling rust memory safety through the lense of multithreading maybe a good approach.
- Moving to rust because it has better memory safety is like migrating from python to elixir because it has better concurrency, its true but it may now mean alot in context.

## Brownfield development is key.
- The company I work at has been around for 40+ years. We have a lot of legacy code.
- Rust developer tooling is amazing for new projects but try inte grating it into a legacy codebase.
- Rust has great FFI tools and its macro system makes such tooling an amazing (and sometimes opaque) experience.
- If I cannot integrate rust into my existing codebase, I am not going to use it.
- We are not talking about migrating 5 year code, we are taling about code that has been around for 20+ years.
- Rust may actually make it slower. 

## Bind me hard. 
- Python bindings are at the core of our industry.
- We have a lot of legacy code that needs to interop with C/C++ code.
- Highlighting rusts ability to bind to other languages is a huge selling point.
- Macros are fucking amazing
